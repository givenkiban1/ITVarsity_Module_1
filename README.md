# ITVarsity_Module_1

For this Module, I'm required to come up with an app that will have different features, users, etc. lol very vague requirement. This is a module from IT Varsity, In partnership with MTN APP ACADEMY. Upon completion of program, we'll be receiving certificates.


# My idea

So this is not an original idea, but it's something i want to work on. I was inspired by a 18 year old kid (current age), whom at 16 years of age, created a taxi maths app. This is super useful here in South Africa, because anytime you get into a taxi, the person sitting at the front will receive everyone's taxi fare and they have to give change to people who need it and also make sure that the driver gets the correct amount. This person takes the role of a "taxi conductor".

This causes some people stress, anxiety and a lot of the time, makes people not want to sit at the frontseat of the taxi.

# Solution

An app which can help the "taxi conductor" give everyone their correct change and also ensure that the driver get's his full expected income per trip.

# How

Before the trip starts, the user opens the app, enters the fare of the current taxi trip, since each different trip the user takes might have different costs. When the user is done with the configuration, they can press "START" and now start accepting the passenger fares. As the "Taxi Conductor" begins to recieve money, they are presented with a number pad/calculator like UI which allows them to tap in the amount they've received and how many users this is for. When done, they press next to recieve the next passenger's fare and so forth.

When done, they can press "Done", and the app will show how much change to return to each passenger.

ie/ if someone passes money forward, like R50 and it's for 2 passengers. The app calculates how much goes to the driver, ie. R20 and R30 is thus change. The app will thus show that R30 change should be returned to the person who gave the R50 for 2 passengers, etc.

This app is an improvement of the original idea, by the 16 year old as it's more user friendly and allows all the money to be received first before calculating how much to be returned.

# Extras
There will also be a whatsapp bot which users can message to perform the same calculations if they're out of storage and can't download the app.
